      <p>Layer mask is composed of black and white areas and this simply says whether parts (pixels) are visible or not. It enables us to easily edit the brightness, contrast, exposure etc. or to separate the product from the background of photos. Our standard turnaround time is 24 hours. But faster service is possible as per clientâ€™s requisite. The turnaround time depends on the volume and complicity of the job.</p>
